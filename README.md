These are *opinonated* snippets I find useful in the construction of Shopify projects.

They may or may not be useful to you. My intention behind the extension is to use it as
a learning excercise, and also to make them project-agnostic.

All subject to change - and I change my mind frequently.

Ideally, the snippet files should follow this format also - large affects to smaller.
(Scaffold, Component, Wrap, Tag).

## Snippet terminology

| Command | Example | Description
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| `scaffold-` | `scaffold-section` | Scaffolds a 'section' or 'snippet'.
| `component-` | `component-section` | Adds the HTML structure for a component, such as as 'section' or a 'table'.
| `wrap-` | `wrap-if` | Surrounds the highlighted code. For example an 'if' statement.
| `tag-` | `tag-liquid` | (Liquid only) Boilerplated tags. For example, `{% liquid %}`.
